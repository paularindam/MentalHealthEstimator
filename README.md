# MentalHealthEstimator
This project tries to address the issue of building a predictive system for identifying mental health posts. In the first iteration, we focus only on depression. 

The columns for the fcb.npy file is 'post_id','time','message','num_likes','num_comments','university','country'. 

The sample Yaks contains only the text information.
